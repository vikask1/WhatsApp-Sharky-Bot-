Modern sharks are classified within the clade Selachimorpha and are the sister group to the rays.\n\nHABITAT\n\nSharks are found from shallow to deep sea environments, in coastal, marine and oceanic environments the world over. Some species inhabit shallow, coastal regions, while others live in deep waters, on the ocean floor and in the open ocean.\n\nLIFE CYCLE\n\nA female white shark gives birth to just five or so ‚Äúpups‚Äù every other year. Their slow reproduction process makes white sharks vulnerable to extinction. Scientists classify white sharks into five different life stages: Pups, Young of the Year, Juveniles, Subadults and Adults.\n\nPREDATORS\n\nGastropods aren't the only organisms known to prey on elasmobranch eggs ‚Äì other elasmobranchs, bony fishes, seals, whales and even monkeys are known to consume shark and ray eggs.",
